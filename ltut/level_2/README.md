# Catching bugs üêõ

In level 2 you will learn how to catch bugs with [flake8-bugbear](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-bugbear-b).

Run the following command to find the bugs:

```
ruff check --select B example.py
```

When you addressed these issues (run the command again to see if everything was resolved) you can continue to [`ltut/level_3`](https://github.com/dobraczka/linting-tutorial/blob/main/ltut/level_3/README.md).
