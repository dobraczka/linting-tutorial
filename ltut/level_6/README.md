# It's not just a linter that annoys you! 

Many of you have probably heard of [pylint](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint) and already use it.
Ruff makes these rules [available](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#pylint-pl) as well.

```
ruff check --select PL example.py
```

There are different ways to address the raised issues here.
One possible way is shown in `ltut/level_6_solution/example.py`.
